# Communication with the Linux system

One part of zeST runs on your board's Arm CPU, running a Linux embedded environment.
zeST uses a specific piece of software running on Linux, providing simplified access to the USB peripherals and storage media for emulation
of Atari-compatible peripherals (keyboard, mouse, joystick, floppy drive, etc).

zeST's Linux operating system is an embedded system built using [Buildroot](https://buildroot.org/).
It is a minimal system that runs in a ramdisk.
An overlay file system image (named `overlay` in the root of the SDÂ card) is created on first boot,
and is used to permanently store file modifications in specific locations such as `/etc` or `/var`.
This allows you to configure specific aspects that are not (yet) managed by the zeST configuration
interface, such as networking or wireless devices.

Since it is a fully functional Linux system, it comes with file management tools, a text editor (`vi`),
and other command line utilities.

Advanced or even intermediary users can interact with it, to perform different tasks:
managing files, transferring files from/to your personal computer, configuration, and more,
directly on the board's filesystem.

This document presents ways to interact with the zeST board using a computer (PC running Windows or Linux, Mac).

## Serial console

For serial access you will need a terminal emulator on the computer.

 - on Windows or Mac, you can use a tool like [Tabby](https://tabby.sh/).
 - on Linux: minicom

The board's serial port is configured at 921600 bps, 8 bit, 1 stop bit, so configure your terminal emulator accordingly.
This setting has been chosen to speed up file transfers through serial.
Typical serial port is `COM8` on Windows, or `/dev/ttyUSB0` on Linux.

Connect your board to the computer with a standard USB cable.
That cable must be connected to the UART port of the board.

Once connected to the board, press Enter.
This should display a `Login:` prompt.
Type `root`, press Enter, and if you see the `#` prompt, this means you have successfully connected to the root account on the board.

This is a standard [unix shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell) session, so you can issue the usual shell commands.
We will not describe here how to use a unix shell, there are plenty of useful webpages for that, such as [this one](https://www.stationx.net/unix-commands-cheat-sheet/) or [this one](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/basic-shell-commands-in-linux/).



## SSH over ethernet

Ethernet is working; it is configured to detect its IP address with DHCP.
However, in current releases of zeST, there is no SSH server configured.
This will be fixed in the future, once a valid, ramdisk-friendly, secure solution is established.


## Start and stop zeST

Before manipulating files that are being used in zeST (such as the hard disk image file), you need to stop zeST.
This is done with the command:

    zestboot stop

To start zeST again:

    zestboot start

To just restart zeST:

    zestboot restart

Note that the `zestboot` script runs zeST so that it uses the default `/sdcard/zest.cfg` configuration file.
You can have it use a different configuration file with the command:

    zeST /path/to/config.cfg

In that case, zeST runs as a foreground process.
You can stop it again by pressing Ctrl+C.


## SD card mount point

The contents of the SD card can be seen in the `/sdcard` folder.

## File transfer through serial (zmodem)

To send a file from the computer to the current directory of your shell session, just initiate a zmodem transfer on your terminal utility (minicom: press Ctrl+a, then s).
The terminal utility will make use of the pre-installed `rz` command on the zeST linux system so the files are written on the current directory.

To send a file from the zeST shell session to your computer, use the `sz filename` command.

## Mount a partition from an Atari-formatted hard disk image file

Mounting a partition gives you access to its contents in a system directory.
From there you can copy, rename, delete files, transfer them with zmodem or ssh, whatever you may do on a regular disk drive.

**Warning #1**: Make sure you have stopped zeST before doing the following operations.
There is a risk that your data gets corrupted if you access the contents of the image when zeST is already accessing it.
To stop zeST, follow the instructions in the [Start and stop zeST](#start-and-stop-zest) section.

**Warning #2**: Once you are done with file management in the partition, you must unmount it before starting zeST again.

To mount the partition, you need to know the beginning sector number for that partition.
Those are listed when you partition the disk with your partitioning tool.
The first partition (partition C) normally should start from sector 2.

From the sector number, you can deduce an *offset* by multiplying it by 512.
Thus, if your partition C starts from sector 2, the offset should be 1024.

The command for mounting a partition with offset 1024 from an image file located in `/sdcard/hdd.img` is the following:

    mount -oloop,offset=1024 -tmsdos /sdcard/hdd.img /mnt

The partition contents should then be accessible in the `/mnt` folder.
You can perform any file copies, deletions, renames, as you want.

When you are done with your modifications, unmount the partition with the command:

    umount /mnt


# Bluetooth configuration

The Linux system has basic support for Bluetooth through the use of a USB Bluetooth dongle.
This allows you to pair wireless devices such as a keyboard, a mouse or a game controller.

For now, Bluetooth is configured from the command line, using the `bluetoothctl` utility.

The basic use is the following.
After starting `bluetoothctl`, power up the device with the command:

```
power on
```

To pair a new device, set it in pair mode, then type the command:

```
scan on
```

A list of devices should appear, with their respective MAC addresses.
When you see your device, supposing its MAC address is `11:22:33:44:55:66`,
connect to it with the command:

```
connect 11:22:33:44:55:66
```

**note:** you do not have to type the whole MAC address.
Just type the first digits/characters and use the **Tab** key to auto complete.

After a successful connection, you can pair it with the command:

```
pair 11:22:33:44:55:66
```

From there, your device should be usable in zeST.
To have the device automatically paired each time it is turned on, type the command:

```
trust 11:22:33:44:55:66
```
