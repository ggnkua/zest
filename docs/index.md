# Welcome to the zeST documentation

zeST is a free, open-source (GPLv3-licenced), full featured Atari ST clone, running on low end commercial FPGA prototyping boards.

The goal is to achieve cycle-exact compatibility with the original hardware,
allowing the known (and yet unknown!) hardware tricks to increase the number of displayed colours,
remove borders, perform hardware scrolling, etc.

For recent news, contact information, access to the source code etc, please visit the [project page](https://zest.sector1.fr/).
